    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A muffuletta is both a type of sandwich invented by Italian immigrants in
      New Orleans and the type of bread it's served on. A muffuletta consists of
      a halved muffuletta loaf with deli meats (usually salami, ham, and
      mortadella) and olive spread. The large sandwich is cut into quarters, so
      one loaf of bread produces at least four servings.
