    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A muffuletta is both a type of sandwich invented by Italian immigrants in
      New Orleans and the type of bread it's served on. A muffuletta consists of
      a halved muffuletta loaf with deli meats (usually salami, ham, and
      mortadella) and olive spread. The large sandwich is cut into quarters, so
      one loaf of bread produces at least four servings.

      <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Sandwiches:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
      <li>8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami</li>
      <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mortadella</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata
        olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers,
        celery, and carrot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium
        bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and
        transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container).
        Pour in more oil to cover if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow
        out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad,
        including oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella,
        mozzarella, and Provolone slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this
        will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into
        the bread.
      </li>
    </ol>
